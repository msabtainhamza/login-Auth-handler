# Login-Handler ðŸš€

Login-Handler is a React-based web application that aims to provide a seamless user authentication experience. The highlight of this project is its ability to remember a user's login status, ensuring they don't have to log in repeatedly unless they log out. 

## Features ðŸŒŸ
- **Persistent Login**: Once logged in, users won't be prompted to log in again until they manually log out.
- **React Hooks**: Implementation includes both `useEffect()` and `useState()` hooks to handle user state and side effects.
- **React Fragments & Portals**: The project leverages the power of React fragments and portals to simplify the DOM structure and render children outside the DOM hierarchy.
- **CSS Modules**: Styling is achieved using CSS modules, ensuring a modular and scoped styling approach.
- **Direct DOM Manipulation**: With the help of `useRef()`, we've harnessed the power of direct DOM manipulation through `react-dom`.
